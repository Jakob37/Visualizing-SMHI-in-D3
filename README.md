Work in progress version: https://jakob37.github.io/Visualizing-SMHI-in-D3/

Aims:

* Get a better understanding of the meteorological data in Sweden (which stretches back to the 19th century)
* Learn and apply D3 knowledge
* Present both the data and the knowledge in a way to make it accessible for others

Methods:

* Retrieve historical data from various stations across Sweden, from SMHI
* Use R to do preliminary data parsing and exploration, preparing for charting in D3
* Build an interactive D3 visualization allowing exploration of the pre-processed SMHI data
* Write a hands-on D3 tutorial together with the produced code

If you find this, and think it sounds interesting to you. Tell me! It will greatly increase the chances of this project being finished ;)
